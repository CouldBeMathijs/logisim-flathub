  <description>
    <p>Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. With its
      simple toolbar interface and simulation of circuits as you build them, it is simple enough to
      facilitate learning the most basic concepts related to logic circuits. With the capacity to
      build larger circuits from smaller subcircuits, and to draw bundles of wires with a single
      mouse drag, Logisim can be used (and is used) to design and simulate entire CPUs for
      educational purposes.</p>
    <p>Logisim is used by students at colleges and universities around the world in many types of
      classes, ranging from a brief unit on logic in general-education computer science surveys, to
      computer organization courses, to full-semester courses on computer architecture.</p>
